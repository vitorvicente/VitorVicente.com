# VitorVicente.com

This website serves as my main personal Webpage where you can follow my projects, see my CV, and contact me directly.

It's currently a simple HTML & CSS website that uses Bootstrap as well as GeoPlugin.net's API to re-direct the user to the section of the website based on their location/language. It was developed as the first part of an 100 day coding challenge for web development, and will, in the future, be upgraded to a React.JS WebApp, with cookie support for the language choice.

It's made up of several pages/sections which are listed in the Site-Map bellow.

### Running & Bug Finding
If you want to run the website to test for bugs or just mess around, all you have to do is download it and open the HTML files with your prefered browser.

If you want to look at the language choice page, make sure do remove the onLoad="redirect()" tag on the body section. Please be warned that if you run this page without disabling this you will be re-directed to the live website.

Feel free to report bugs at the bug page here on GitHub and I'll address them!
